# Little Chef

Little Chef is an AI assistant in a Next.js webapp designed to help you track, manage, and cook recipes. When it's complete, it will contain:
 - A landing page with a box to chat with an AI and start a new recipe
 - A sidebar with a list of existing recipes
 - When a new recipe is generated, it is automatically parsed into a recipe list and a list of instructions
 - Mentions of ingredients or timers in the recipe instructions have mouse-over tooltips
 - An AI assistant who can help you edit or make the recipe
